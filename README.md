## About Me
I enjoy problems and the challenge of solving them. While researching at KBCC, I aided in writing Mathematica code for modeling a 1-D chain of several electrons and their interactions without any formal knowledge of quantum mechanics. As a graduate of QC, I mathematically modeled the measurement process of an electron spin passing through a bridge. 

I am interested in machine learning and neural networking, especially its applications to physics, finance, and medicine via medical devices and biomechatronics.
